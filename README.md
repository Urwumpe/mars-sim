# mars-sim
The Mars Simulation Project is a Java based open source project that simulates the activities of the first generation of settlers on Mars with a higher fidelity of simulation than a typical PC strategy game. 


## Simulation
mars-sim is a `general purpose` simulator depicting the early development of the human settlements on Mars. According to EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Computer Simulation is the use of a computer to represent the dynamic responses of one system by the behavior of another system modeled after it. A simulation is a mathematical description, or model, of a real system in the form of a computer program. 

mars-sim attempts to incorporate as much mathematical modeling of many systems or scientific disciplines (such as in physics, chemistry, biology, economics, psychology, and social science) as possible to simulate the dynamics and behaviors of people, systems, and environment. 

As each settler in mars-sim is a computer agent possessing certain properties, one has prescribed properties and the external characteristics imposed on them, they make weight decisions and interact with one another to produce unexpected results in a sandbox world.

For instance, each settler has a well-defined job, a role, a bunch of technical [skills](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Skills), a set of personality, natural [attributes](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Attributes), and task preferences (likes and dislikes). They build [relationship](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Relationship) as they interact and work with one another. They are there to live, dream, explore, and settle Mars. 


## Operation Modeling
mars-sim adopts a rich set of scientific vocabulary from research journal and paper when it comes to defining operation paradigms and programming models based on the present day technologies that are applicable for the near-term human exploration and settlement on Mars.

For instance, a low pressure atmosphere of 34 kPa (5 psi) is chosen for humans to live inside the settlement, as opposed to the Earth's 
sea level atmosphere of 101 kPa (14.7 psi). The amount of oxygen (at 58.8% composition), carbon dioxide, and water moisture indoor are continuously monitored 
and replenished periodically in each building being equipped with various life-support system [functions](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Building-Function). These gases are generated via systems such as Sabatier Reverse Water Gas (SRWG), and Oxygen Generation System, etc..

Another example is the mode of operation involved in EVA. Prior to each EVA activity, one of the settlers will be selected as the airlock operator. The airlock would have to be pressurized and depressurized (gases captured and released and reheated) with inner/outer doors opened and closed at a specific sequence in order to allow the ingress/egress of the settlers onto the surface of Mars.

The third example is the [Radiation Modeling](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Radiation-Exposure), which accounts for how often the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) and Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) would occur during EVA as the dose is closely monitored and tracked presumably over the career lifetime of a settler. 
 
## Settlement Development 
Player may create numerous settlements spreading across the surface of Mars. Each settlement has a command structure and a development [objective](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Settlement-Objective). They can be as simple as a four-person initial base (loosely following the Mars Direct Mission Plan by Robert Zubrin), a trading outpost, a mining depot near sites with high mineral concentration; or a self-contained colony with 48+ settlers having an elected mayor. 


## Economics
In terms of economic modeling, mars-sim implements a value point (VP) system, which keeps track of the supply and demand on each resource. There is no standard currency established yet. Traders barter trades with neighboring settlements and the surplus/ deficit based on the 
VPs of the resources in exchanged would be computed in each trading session.


## Jobs and Missions
Settlers spend much of their time learning to "live off the land". Assigning meaningful [jobs](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Jobs) to the settlers are vital to the health of the economy of the settlements. Settlers engage in various [tasks](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Tasks) such as maintenance, ensuring life support resources are well balanced, growing crops in [greenhouses](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Greenhouse-Operation), making secondary [food products](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Food-Production), and manufacturing needed parts and equipment in workshops.

Settlers will also go out on field [Missions](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Missions) to explore and study the surrounding landscapes, to prospect and mine minerals, and to trade with neighboring settlements, etc. They may even decide to migrate from one settlement to another.


## Reliability and Malfunctions
The perils of living on Mars are very real. There are close to 30 types of [Malfunctions](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Field-Reliability-and-Malfunctions) that can strike. The failure rate, the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and the reliability of parts are tracked real-time and updated dynamically based on field available data during the simulation.


## Summary
Mars is a harsh world but is certainly less unforgiving than our Moon. Settlers come face-to-face with accidents, equipment malfunctions, illnesses, injuries, and even death. Survival depends on how well they work together, improve their survival skills and balance individual versus settlement needs. The reward of

As the settlers learn how to survive the hardship and build up their settlements, players are rewarded with the pure joy of participating in this grand social experiment of creating a new branch of human society on another planetary surface.

## Wiki

## Supported Platforms
* Windows
* MacOS (known bugs in displaying certain fonts of some websites in Help Browser)
* Linux (cannot input text in text fields)


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Require JRE/JDK 8 (u77 or above) for binaries compiled under Java 8 
* Require JRE/JDK 9+ for binaries compiled under Java 9
* For Windows OS, one should manually set up the following : 
  - Edit the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` in the System's "Environment Variables" in Control Panel 
  - Set `JAVA_HOME` to a JRE or JDK's destination such as `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-10.0.2` or `C:\Program Files\Java\jre-10.0.2`
  - Add `%JAVA_HOME%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;` to `PATH`         
  - Remove any path similar to `C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath;`  in `PATH` variable. It interferes with the correct version of 
    Java that should be used. 
  - Check if the correct version of Java is being enable in "Java Control Panel" in Windows's Control Panel. 

> Note 1 : The order of precedence inside `PATH` is crucial. The first available folder having Java executable inside will be the one to be loaded  by Windows OS. 

> Note 2 : The BEST approach is to enable only one Java build (such as Java 10.0.2) inside `PATH` and remove  all other folders referencing other java versions/builds.

> Note 3 : To test the version of Java that your machine is using, type "java -version" in a terminal/command prompt.

> Note 4 : Remove all Java related executables inside the folder `C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath` in order to avoid loading the undesired version of jre/jdk.
