.TH MARS-SIM 1 "21 Jul 2020" "version 0.6"
.SH NAME
mars-sim \- A Simulation of the Future Initial Human Settlements on the Red Planet.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mars-sim
.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP This manual page briefly documents the \fBMars Simulation Project\fP, an open source
Mars settlement simulator.
.PP
.TP The Mars Simulation Project is a Java-based project that simulates the
mission planning, the activities and the organizational structures of the first 
generation of settlers in the settlements of Mars. 
.PP
.SH Modeling and Simulation
.TP Each settler has unique career attributes, capable of making distinct decisions
on a virtual Mars and interacting with one another and the settlement. As a simulation, 
mars-sim models the professional interaction between settlers in terms of their job type, 
role type, technical skills, personality, natural attributes, prior training, preferences 
and relationship with one another. It also attempts to model various aspects of the 
environment surrounding the human settlement as scientific as possible.
.PP
.TP Settlers are subject to fatigue, hunger, stress and other health factors and can get sick.
Radiation exposure is accounted for and EVA operations are prevented during Solar Events.
Meteorite Impact are usually infrequent. Greenhouse farming is crucial for survival.
.PP
.TP Player may create numerous settlements spreading across the surface of Mars such as a
simple 4-person initial landing base, a mining site, or a more self-contained settlement
hosting higher functions.
.PP
.TP Each settlement has a command structure, a developmental objective, and an economic system 
called Value Point (VP), which keeps track of the supply and demand on each good and resource. 
.PP
Tasks and Missions
.TP Initially most settlers will spend much of their time learning to "live off the land".
They will be busy in maintenance, ensuring life support resources are well balanced,
growing crops in greenhouses, and manufacturing needed parts and equipment in workshops.
.PP
.TP Settlers will also go out on rover missions to explore and study surrounding landscapes,
prospect and mine minerals, and trade with neighboring settlements via trading missions.
Summary
.TP Mars is a harsh world but is certainly less unforgiving than our Moon. Settlers come
face-to-face with accidents, equipment malfunctions, illnesses, injuries, and even death.
Survival depends on how well they work together, improve their survival skills and balance
individual vs. settlement needs. See GitHub site at https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim 
for developer details and the general project website at https://mars-sim.github.io/ 
on this open source project.
.SH OVERVIEW
.TP At the start, a spinning Mars globe appears under the title/version. By hovering the
mouse cursor over it, the main menu options appear on the lower right. Select "New Sim" and the
Config Editor will pop open. In the editor, user may add/delete settlements and configure
initial conditions. Click the person button to open the Crew Editor to customize the alpha
crew members and choose what settlement to send the crew. Click the start button will
begin the simulation. A Main Window will appear with the help browser open. User may go
through the tutorial/user guide that explain the concept and basic mechanics of the mars-sim.
