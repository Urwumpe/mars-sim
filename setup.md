---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Minimum Requirements 

- Dual Core Pentium/Celeron 1.5GHz or higher

- 1.5 GB free RAM

- 220 MB free disk space

- Java 14 or openjdk 14

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation

- Install the latest Java JRE or JDK on your machine. 
  See `Prerequisites` at [README.md](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/blob/master/README.md) 

- Download a binary edition of your choice.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Starting a new sim

Your mars-sim package may or may not come with JavaFX components.

A. Batch Edition

In Windows OS, double click on "mars-sim.bat" to begin.
In Linux/MacOS, type "./mars-sim" to begin.

Note 1: player may have to edit the content of the mars-sim.bat so that the jarfile name is being matched up.

B. Debian Edition (either Swing GUI or Headless) 

- If you have installed the debian version of mars-sim, type 
`./mars-sim` to begin.

C. Swing Edition

- Double-click on `[$VERSION]_swing_java14.jar` to begin
a new simulation in GUI mode as the jar file is executable
in most operating systems.

- Choose 'New Sim' to start a new simulation in the console menu.

Alternatively, players may start mars-sim from a terminal / command line.

- Go to the directory containing the jar file and type :

> java -jar [$VERSION]_swing_java14.jar

	OR

> java -jar [$VERSION]_swing_java14.jar new

This gives users the advantage of seeing mars-sim's internal logging
statements while running mars-sim.

Note a: replacing [$VERSION] with the current version or build.

Note b: the argument 'new' is optional. If the argument 'load'
is not provided for, it will assume that the user is interested in
starting a new simulation and 'new' will be appended automatically.

Note c: by default, the simulation will be saved automatically
with a new filename with a date/time stamp, the # of sol and
the build # once every 15 minutes. It's located in the
`\[$HOME]\.mars-sim\autosave\` directory, as dictated by the
following attribute value in simulation.xml :

	<autosave-interval value="15.0" />

D. Headless Edition

mars-sim is designed with a high level of autonomy. It's capable
of running the entire simulation on its own. Therefore, one may 
prefer to run it in a terminal for hours/days without GUI and in the 
least intrusive manner utilizing minimal CPU resources. Type :

> java -jar [$VERSION]_headless_java14.jar

	OR

> java -jar [$VERSION]_headless_java14.jar new

Note a: the 'new' argument is optional.

Note b: by default, the simulation will be saved automatically
(as default.sim in the \.mars-sim\saved\ directory) once every
15 minutes, as dictated by the following attribute value in
simulation.xml :

	<autosave-interval value="15.0" />

- One may alter the default time ratio for faster simulation
  by adding `512x` or `1024x` as follows when starting a new
  sim or loading from a saved sim :

> java -jar [$VERSION]_headless_java14.jar 512x

	OR

> java -jar [$VERSION]_headless_java14.jar 1024x

Note d: the time ratio argument is optional and is by default
        `256x` as defined in Simulations.xml.

>    load 123.sim    load the sim with filename '123.sim'
>                    (Note : '123.sim' must be located at the same 
>                            folder as the jarfile)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Memory Allocation

- The maximum memory allocation for mars-sim is adjustable prior to the
start of the simulation.

- By default, mars-sim uses up to 1 GB maximum memory.

- If your machine has less than 1 GB or more than 1 GB, you may
customize mars-sim to run at one of the configuration by adding a
numeral argument after the jar file as shown below :

> java -jar mars-sim-main-[$VERSION].jar 4

- Below are options :
// no numerical --> 256MB Min, 1536MB Max (by default)
// 0 --> 256MB Min, 1024MB Max
// 1 --> 256MB Min, 512MB Max
// 2 --> 256MB Min, 768MB Max
// 3 --> 256MB Min, 1024MB Max
// 4 --> 256MB Min, 1536MB Max
// 5 --> 256MB Min, 2048MB Max


---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Loading Saved Simulation

A. GUI Mode

If you want to load a previously saved simulation in graphic mode,

- Start the mars-sim

- Choose `Load Sim` in the Main Menu

- Select the `default.sim` or a *.sim in the FileChooser


Alternatively, you may type in a command line :

> java -jar mars-sim-[$VERSION].jar 3 load

This will load the FileChooser and open up 
`[$HOME]\.mars-sim\saved\` in a window panel.

Note 1: the order of the arguments is NOT important

Note 2: by default, it is assumed the user is interested in
loading the default saved sim file. You do NOT need to type 
`default.sim` as an argument. `default.sim` is located 
at `[$HOME]\.mars-sim\saved\`.

  OR

> java -jar mars-sim-[$VERSION].jar 3 load 123.sim

This will load `123.sim`, instead of the default saved sim.

Note 3: the order of the arguments is NOT important.

Note 4: `123.sim` must be present in the same directory
where the jar file is at.


B. Headless Mode

To load the default saved sim without the graphic interface, type :

> java -jar mars-sim-[$VERSION].jar 3 headless load

Note 1: the order of the arguments is not important.

Note 2: by default, it is assumed the user is interested in
loading the default saved sim file. You do NOT need to type 
`default.sim` as an argument. `default.sim` is located 
at `[$HOME]\.mars-sim\saved\`.

  OR

> java -jar mars-sim-[$VERSION].jar 3 headless load 123.sim

This will load `123.sim`, instead of the default saved sim.

Note 3: the order of the arguments is NOT important.

Note 4: `123.sim` must be present in the same directory
where the jar file is at.
