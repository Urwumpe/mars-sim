		<!-- The base time ratio (TR) is the default simulation time ratio : the ratio of real time to sim time prior to modification
			Note 1 : It denotes the speed of the simulation
			     2 : Value must be positive number between 16 and 2048 and cannot be zero
			     3 : the calculated TR is dependent upon the # of cpu threads available on user's machine. 
			         The base TR value below will be overridden by the calculated TR at the start of the sim..
