			photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) for the (400-700) nm waveband was in umol / m^2 / s."

			Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) refers to the range of light wavelengths between 
			400 and 700 nanometers (nm) that are used by plants for photosynthesis.
			
 			This range corresponds to the visible light spectrum, which includes blue, green, and red 
 			wavelengths.
 			
 			PAR is measured in units such as micromoles of quanta per second per square meter [µmol / s / m^2].
 			
			growing-sols : # of sols
			crop-category : the type of crop
			edible-biomass : [ kg / m^2 / year ]
			edible-water-content : in proportion of 1 (1 is 100%)
			inedible-biomass :  [ kg / m^2 / year ]
			daily-PAR : [ mol / m^2 / day ], not [ umol / m^2 / s ]	
			
			On Earth, 1 W/m² ≈ 4.609 μmol/m²/s comes from the Plant Growth Chamber Handbook (chapter 1, radiation; 
			https://www.controlledenvironments.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/06/Ch01.pdf)
			1/4.609 > 0.2169668
			
			On Mars, 1 W/m² ≈ 4.568 μmol/m²/s
			1/4.568 > 0.2189141856
				
			Since only about 45% of the energy of solar radiation is actually in the 400 - 700 nm range, 
			the conversion of TOTAL solar radiation to PAR is ~2.0556, rather than 4.568.
			.45 * 4.568 = 2.0556
			1/2.0556 > 0.4864759681
			
			1 µmol of photons in the PAR range is approximately equivalent to 0.275 joules (J) of energy.
 
 			To convert this to watts, you would divide by the time in seconds. Therefore, 1 µmol/s 
 			(micromole per second) is approximately 0.275 W.
			
			
			
			
			In general, PAR levels are highest during the summer at mid-day, reaching values of 2,000 to 3,000
	    	millimoles per square meter.
	    	 	
	    	1 t/h or 1 tonnes per hectare ->  0.1 kilogram per square meter.
 			Conversely, 1 kilogram per square meter -> 10 tonnes per hectare.
	    	
	   		1 tonne per acre is approximately equal to 0.2471 kilograms per square meter.
	   		1 kg / m2 -> 4.0469 t per acre

			1 tonne per hectare (t/ha) is equivalent to 0.446 US tons per acre
			
			life-cycle : perennial/annual/biennials
			1. A perennial is a plant that lives for more than two years, as opposed to 
			2. annuals, which complete their life cycle in one year, and 
			3. biennials, which bloom in their second year and die.
			
			Perennials can be categorized into woody plants and herbaceous perennials.
			Woody plants include trees and shrubs, while herbaceous perennials grow 
			and bloom during spring and summer, die back in fall and winter, and 
			return in the spring from their rootstock.

		roughly 28 million hectares of corn produced each year (Perlack, 2005).

		Worldwide, with a yield of over 5 T/ha . Production can be significantly higher in certain regions of the world;
		2009 forecasts for production in Iowa were 11614 kg/ha

		Field corn vs. Sweet corn
		Although field corn is used mostly to create other products, sweet corn can be used as well.
		Plastics are manufactured from 		both types of corn to replace petroleum-based products.
		These include batteries, packaging materials, plastic silverware and other plastic products
		(such as skin and hair care bottles), toothpaste, candles, shampoo and dozens of others.
		A corn-based fuel for transportation, ethanol, is added to gasoline and is sold at many gas stations.

			In future, separate the dandelion roots from dandelion leaves
			
			But now, assume their combined biomass yield is triple that of the root, thus .37 * 3 = 1.11
			
			Studies have shown that under experimental field conditions, the fresh root yield of wild Russian 
			dandelion (Taraxacum koksaghyz) ranged from 1.3 to 1.9 metric tons per hectare in one trial and 
			2.2 to 3.7 metric tons per hectare in another trial
			 
			The fresh root yield would range from approximately 0.13 to 0.19 kg/m² in the first trial and 
			0.22 to 0.37 kg/m² in the second trial.
			  
			Note: Harvest dandelion at 90 sols before seed-bearing phase because seeds are invasive and spread.
			
			use 'flowers', instead of 'seeds' as crop category since we do not intend to harvest seeds as food
			
			Dandelion is a perennial plant. It is a hardy perennial that is grown as an annual for its foliage 
			and as a biennial for its roots.
			
 			The plant has a strong, deep taproot that allows it to persist over the winter.
 			
 			Dandelion is a short-lived perennial that will grow just about anywhere, regardless of soil conditions.
 			
 			The plant is also described as a perennial with a stout taproot, is abundant everywhere but 
 			prefers chalks and loamy soils above pH 7.0.
 
			A flower head can produce up to 400 seeds but the average is 180. A plant may have
			a total of 2,000 to 12,000 seeds (Salisbury, 1961; Stevens, 1932), or even 23,456
			seeds (Stewart-Wade et al., 2002). The average seed number per plant is 2,720
			(Pawlowski et al., 1970). The 1,000 seed weight is given as 0.583 g (Bostock, 1978)
			and 0.620-0.640 g (Stevens, 1932). Seed weight may vary with the time of year it is
			produced. 
			
			The time from flowering to seed ripening takes about 9-12 days. At least 7
			days must elapse before seeds are likely to be viable. Ripe seed gave 90%
			germination but cut down flowering stems did not produce any viable seed (Gill,
			1938). 
 
	    	https://cals.cornell.edu/weed-science/weed-profiles/dandelion
	    	  	
	    	Seed weight: 0.34 mg (seeds produced in summer) to 0.54 mg (seeds produced in spring) (Martinkova et al. 2011, 
	    	Doisy et al. 2014, Milberg et al. 2000, Werle et al. 2014); 0.6 mg (Bostock 1978).
	    	
	    	Seeds will germinate at temperatures from 41 to 95 °F (5 to 35 °C), but percentage germination and speed of 
	    	germination are reduced at temperatures above 68 °F (20 °C) (Luo and Cardina 2012, Washitani 1984).  
	    	Germination is highest at alternating day/night temperatures of 59/41 °F (15/5 °C) and 77/59 °F (25/15 °C), 
	    	and reduced at 95/77 °F (35/25 °C) (Luo and Cardina 2012).
	    	
	    	Seed longevity: Seeds can last 1-5 years in the soil, but in normal agricultural conditions, only a few 
	    	survive to the next season (Stewart-Wade et al. 2002).  The overwhelming majority of seedlings come from 
	    	recently dispersed seeds (Hacault & Van Acker 2006).

			Seeds are killed by storage at 27 °C with 80% humidity.

			Emergence depth:  Emergence is not affected by depth between 0 and 0.8” (2 cm) but declines at progressively 
			greater depths.  No emergence occurs from seeds below 3” (8 cm).  Emergence from small root fragments can 
			occur from 2-4” (5-10 cm) of soil (Stewart-Wade et al. 2002). 
			
			Photosynthetic pathway:  C3 (Stewart-Wade et al. 2002).
			
			Response to shade:  Dandelion is shade tolerant (Stewart-Wade et al. 2002) and will grow even under 
			competitive crops like potato.
			
			Time from emergence to reproduction: Dandelions that have formed a strong taproot and 20 leaves (some of 
			which may have subsequently died) are usually ready to flower (Stewart-Wade et al. 2002).  Peak flowering 
			begins in mid-spring and continues for 2 to 6 weeks (Doll 2006, Honek et al. 2005), but can continue 
			throughout the year with a secondary peak in fall (Gray et al. 1973, Mann and Cavers 1979).  
			
			A few seeds may become viable as early as 3 days after the flowers wither and close, but most are not 
			viable until 6-8 days after flowering in the summer or about 10 days after flowering in the spring or 
			fall (Martinkova et al. 2011).
			
			The roots are used in medicine as a tonic and for their diuretic properties. Dandelion plants release 
			ethylene, a chemical that can affect the growth of neighbouring plants. The plant can carry economically 
			important viruses some of which are seed borne. Nematodes can infest it too.

8.  Lighting Radiation Conversion

	Plants use light energy between 300/400 nm and 700 nm, the region known as
	Photosynthetically Active Radiation or PAR.

	Illumination for plants, also known as "irradiance", is sometimes measured in PAR watts per square meter (W/m2).

	Another means of measuring light quantity for plant growth involves discrete units of quantum flux in the PAR
	region called "photons". This light measurement is an instantaneous reading.

	Researchers measure instantaneous light in terms of photon flux commonly measured in units of
	micromoles per square meter per second [µmoles/m2/s or μmol·m-2·s-1 of PAR], where 1 mole of photons is equal to
	6.022 x 1023 photons.

	This quantum unit quantifies the number of photons (individual particles of energy) used in photosynthesis that
	fall on a square meter (10.8 square feet) every second.

	Daily light integral (DLI) or Daily PAR is the amount of PAR received each day as a function of light intensity
	(instantaneous light: μmol·m-2·s-1) and duration (day).

	It is expressed	as moles of light (mol) per square meter (m-2) per day (d-1), or: mol·m-2·d-1 (moles per day).
	The DLI concept is like a rain gauge.

	Just as a rain gauge collects the total rain in a particular location over a period of time, so DLI measures
	the total amount of PAR received in a day.

	Greenhouse growers can use light meters to measure the number of light photons that accumulate in a square meter
	over a 24-hour period.

9. How much light do plants need?

	• Propagation of plugs and cuttings: 8-12 mol/m2/day (after callus)
	• Bedding plants: 10-12 mol/m2/day or greater
	• Vegetables
		o Hydroponic lettuce 15-17 mol/m2/day if vertical airflow fans are used (greater than
		  this can cause leaf tip burn, a physiological disorder from calcium deficiency that
		  occurs under high light)
		o Tomatoes 20-30+ mol/m2/day (for maximum yield)

11. MPR Model: a crop model that consists of a set of nonlinear polynomial equations, six for each crop,
	developed using multivariate polynomial regression (MPR).

	The dependent variables for three of the six MPR equations are the relative growth rates
	of (a) total dry mass prior to formation of yield bearing organs, (b) total dry mass after the
	formation of yield bearing organs, and (c) yield dry mass.

	The independent variables used in each equation include the average PPF, T, and CO2 values (averaged from planting date up to
	the current time increment t), and the total or yield dry mass at t-1.

	The model-based predictive controller adjusts light intensity, atmospheric/elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration,
	(photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), average daily air temperature (T),

12. E.A. Mitsherlich (1909) proposed a theory of “Law of diminishing returns” states that,
	‘The increase in any crop produce by a unit increment of a deficient factor is proportional to the
	decrement of that factor from the maximum and the response is curvilinear instead of linear’.
	Mitscherlich equation is dy/dx = C (A-Y) where,

		d – increment or change
		dy – amount of increase in yield
		dx – amount of increment of the growth factor x.
		A – Maximum possible yield
		Y – Yield obtained for the given quantity of factor ‘x’ and
		C – Proportionality constant that depends on the nature of the growth factor

	In mars-sim,

		Maximum harvest = max harvest mass [kg per day] * crop's growing day,

		Max harvest mass is daily modified by the availability of

		1. fertilizer
		2. water
		3. CO2
		4. O2
		5. sunlight
		6. planting/daily tending work required vs. served


13. Prior to mars-sim version 3.1.0, there are 4 standard phases of a food crop:

	a. Planting
	b. Germination
	c. Growing

15. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation (http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5642E/x5642e06.htm),
	there is 9 types of vegetable crops based on edible part:

	a. Root vegetables (carrots, beetroot, radish)
	b. Tuber vegetables (Yam, Irish potato)
	c. Corm (Taro)
	d. Stem vegetable (Asparagus)
	e  Leaf vegetables (Lettuce, Amaranth)
	f  Bulb vegetable (Onion, garlic)
	g. Fruit vegetable (Tomato, okra)
	h. Flower vegetables (Broccoli, Cauliflower)
	i. Seed vegetable (Berus, Peas)

18. Annuals - Plants that perform their entire life cycle from seed to flower
	to seed within a single growing season.

	All roots, stems and leaves of the plant die annually.

	Only the dormant seed bridges the gap between one generation and the next.

	Annuals: amaranth, bean, broccoli*, corn, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, fava, gourd, ground cherry,
	lettuce, lima, melon, mustard, okra, pea, peanut, pepper, poppy, potato, radish (non-daikon),
	runner bean, sorghum, spinach, squash, sunflower, tomatillo, tomato, watermelon, cilantro

	Perennials - Plants that persist for many growing seasons. Generally the top portion of
	the plant dies back each winter and regrows the following spring from the same root system
	(e.g. Purple Coneflower). Many perennial plants do keep their leaves year round and offer
	attractive borders and groundcover (e.g. Tickseed, Shasta and Ox-Eyed Daisy).

	Note: WHEN STARTING PERENNIAL PLANTS FROM SEED, BLOOMS WILL BE OBSERVED IN EITHER THE SPRING
	OR SUMMER OF THE SECOND YEAR AND EACH YEAR THEREAFTER (e.g. Ox-Eyed Daisy planted in the
	spring of 1996 will not bloom until the spring of 1997).

	Biennials - Plants which require two years to complete their life cycle. First season growth
	results in a small rosette of leaves near the soil surface. During the second season's
	growth stem elongation, flowering and seed formation occur followed by the entire plant's death.

	Biennials: beet, broccoli*, Brussels sprout, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celeriac, celery,
	chicory, Chinese cabbage, collard, endive, kale, kohlrabi, leek, onion, parsley, parsnip,
	radish (daikon), rutabaga, Swiss chard, turnip

	Annual/Perennial - A plant can behave as an annual or a perennial depending on local climatic
	and geographic growing conditions. In the southern portion of the United States, these plants
	tend to grow much quicker than in the north due to the warmer weather and extended growing season.

    Is cilantro a perennial? Cilantro is an annual herb. After the flowers fade and the seeds mature 
    and dry, the plant will die. You can always start a new plant in the early spring and enjoy the 
    fresh leaves. 
    
    The seeds, otherwise known as coriander, have many culinary uses and a long shelf life.

	For example: a Black-Eyed Susan would behave as an annual if grown in Louisiana; whereas,
	if grown in Ohio, a Black-Eyed Susan would behave as a perennial.

	See http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/wildseed/growing/annual.html

	Today’s savvy gardeners should also expand their plant life cycle know-how to be able to characterize
	winter annuals and tender perennials, as well as long- and short-lived perennials.

	Some perennial plants are woody and will flower and fruit after several years of juvenile growth,
	while others are herbaceous and die back every winter to newly flower and fruit in the spring.

	"Tender perennials" are very sensitive to cold temperatures and are grown as annuals in most climates.

	Several of our beds feature tender perennials like tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and okra that will
	die back at the end of the season due to cold weather.

19. Legume Green Manuring
    http://soiltosupper.com/why-green-manure-crops-are-good-for-your-soil/
    http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/%24department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex133

    Being a legume, Pigeon Pea has the ability to obtain and store nitrogen. This happens with the aid of
    bacteria called ‘Rhizobium’. These bacteria live in nodules on the plants roots and can take nitrogen
    from the air and convert it for the plants use. This is called ‘Nitrogen Fixation’.

    To allow for this process and to use Pigeon Pea and other legumes as a nitrogen improver, the seeds of
    this plant must have an inoculant present when sown. The inoculant contains the bacteria needed for
    the specific legume.

21. root tuber vs. stem tuber

	http://www.biology.lifeeasy.org/3344/difference-between-root-tuber-and-stem-tuber

	e.g. sweet potato is a root tuber, potato is a stem tuber.

	Stem tubers have apical bud, nodes and internodes, scaly leaves and auxiliary buds, and the ability to develop chlorophyll when exposed to sunlight.
	Root tubers do not have these attributes. Both are considered vegetables.

	Root tuber
	1.    It is a swollen root
	2.    Apical bud is absent
	3.    Nodes and internodes are absent
	4.    No development of chlorophyll
	5.    Scaly leaves and auxiliary buds are absent.


	Stem tuber
	1. It is a swollen underground stem
	2. Apical bud is present
	3. Presence of nodes and internodes
	4. On exposure to sunlight, stem tubers may develop chlorophyll
	5. Scaly leaves and auxiliary buds are present.

30. http://extension.illinois.edu/bulbs/bulbbasics.cfm

	Corms vs. Bulbs :

	Bulbs can be broken down into five types of storage structures.
	These include: true bulbs, corms, tubers, tuberous roots and rhizomes.
	A sixth category of fleshy roots has been added here for the purpose of showing the structure.
	e.g. Daylilies and peonies, are popular bulb plants with gardeners.

	A corm is a swollen stem base that is modified into a mass of storage tissue.
	A corm does not have visible storage rings when cut in half. This distinguishes it from a true bulb.
	The corm contains a basal plate (bottom of bulb from which roots develop),thin tunic and a growing point.
	e.g. Plants that develop from corms include gladiolus, crocus, and autumn crocus.

33. The Federal Biological Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry (BBA) published 
	from 1979 until 1988 the leaflet series 27 (MEIER, 1985) (Fig. 1). The structure of
	the individual scales was in general based on the publication of ZADOKS et al. (1974). 
	The BBCH coding system is an advancement of the Zadoks coding system, because it
	includes mono- and dikotyledoneous plants. The need for a common understanding of 
	terminology is also important for the description of the phenological growth stages 
	of plants. The BBCH scheme is a good basis to satisfy this scientific demand.
	
	Principal growth stages

	0 Germination / sprouting / bud development
	1 Leaf development (main shoot)
	2 Formation of side shoots / tillering
	3 Stem elongation or rosette growth / shoot development (main shoot)
	4 Development of harvestable vegetative plant parts or vegetatively propagated organs / booting (main shoot)
	5 Inflorescence emergence (main shoot) / heading
	6 Flowering (main shoot)
	7 Development of fruit
	8 Ripening or maturity of fruit and seed
	9 Senescence, beginning of dormancy
