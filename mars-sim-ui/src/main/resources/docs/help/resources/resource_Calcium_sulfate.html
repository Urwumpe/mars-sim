<h2>Resource : "Calcium sulfate" (Solid)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ul><li>
		CaSO4 has a molecular weight of 136.14 g/mol. Derived from limestone, it 
		occurs naturally in the form of gypsum, and may be used as a sequestrant 
		in food as well as a buffer and firming agent. Artificial sweetener base, 
		bleaching agent for bread rolls, flour, tinned tomatoes, soy tofu, 
		dried egg, cheese products, tooth paste. Used in mortar, 
		cement and plaster of Paris. Calcium sulfate has a long history of use 
		in medicine and dentistry, including bone regeneration as a graft material 
		and graft binder/extender, and as a barrier in guided tissue regeneration.
		
		Crystalline phases of CaSO4 
		(1). Anhydrite. CaSO4.
		(2). Dihydrate. CaSO4·2H2O. Called gypsum, as a bleaching agent for crude
		     soya bean vegetable oil
	 	(3). Hemihydrate. CaSO4.1⁄2H2O). bassanite. Also called plaster of Paris.
	 	
	 	Calcium sulfate, 516 or E516, a common laboratory and industrial chemical. 
	 	Also used as a coagulant in products like tofu.
	 	
	 	CaSO4 is used as a coating agent for papers and adds thickness and 
	 	durability, making the paper harder to rip. 

	 	Specifically, it's used in cooking as a 
		a. Firming agent - Helps maintain firmness of fruits and vegetables or interacts with 
		   gelling agents to strengthen food structure. 
		b. Flour treatment agent - A substance that improves baking quality or colour of flour. 
		c. Sequestrant - A substance which controls the availability of a cation. 
		d. Stabiliser - A substance that maintains the uniform dispersal of substances in a food.
