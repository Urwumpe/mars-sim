<h2>Resource : "Ethylene glycol" (Liquid)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ul><li> 
		Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, flammable, and viscous liquid.
		
		It's commonly used in various industrial and consumer products, including antifreeze, 
		hydraulic brake fluids, some stamp pad inks, ballpoint pens, solvents, paints, 
		plastics, films, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical vehicles.
		
		It is also used as a raw material in the manufacture of polyester fibers and
		primarily used as a component of de-icer and anti-icer/anti-freeze fluid 
		used in aircraft de-icing and anti-icing operations, and as an anti-freeze 
		component in motor vehicles.
		
		Ethylene glycol is a popular refrigerants ingredient due to its excellent 
		heat transfer properties and is used in a wide variety of heating and cooling
		applications such as HVAC systems, plastic mould making, food, and pharmaceutical
		processes.
