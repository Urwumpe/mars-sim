<h2>Resource : "Iron Chloride" (Solid)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ol><li>Iron(III) chloride, also called ferric chloride, 
	is an industrial scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with 
	iron in the +3 oxidation state. When dissolved in water, iron(III) chloride undergoes 
	hydrolysis and gives off heat in an exothermic reaction. The resulting brown, acidic, and 
	corrosive solution is used as a flocculant in sewage treatment and drinking water production, 
	and as an etchant for copper-based metals in printed circuit boards. Extracted from akaganeite.</li></ol></p><br/>
