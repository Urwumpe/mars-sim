<h2>Resource : "Kevlar" (Solid)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ul><li> Kevlar is a trademark for one of DuPont’s 
		aramid products as both Kevlar and Nomex are examples of chemicals called synthetic aromatic
		polyamides or aramids for short. The fundamental structure of an aramid is C14H14N2O4.
		Aramid fibers are short for aromatic polyamide. They are manufactured fibers where the 
		composition is a type of synthetic polyamide, in which more than 85% of the linkages must 
		link to two aromatic rings. Kevlar is prone to soaking up water in composite applications 
		and it’s not ideal in compression, so fiberglass and carbon fiber are used in composites 
		rather than Kevlar in those situations.</li></ul></p><br/>
