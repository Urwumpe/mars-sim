<h2>Resource : "Perchlorate" (Solid)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ul><li> 
		Perchlorate salts such as magnesium perchlorate Mg(ClO4)2 is a powerful 
		oxidizing agent. 
		
		The salt is also a superior desiccant (drying agent)  
		to dry gas or air samples for gas analysis.  
		
		Perchlorates have been found on Mars. Being a drying agent, it retains 
		water from the atmosphere and may release it when conditions are 
		favorable and temperature is above 273 K. 
		
		Briny solutions that contain salts such as magnesium perchlorate 
		have a lower melting point than that of pure water. 
		
		The abundance of perchlorate salts on Mars could support the theory 
		that liquid aqueous solutions might exist on or below the surface, 
		where temperature and pressure conditions would ordinarily cause
		the water to freeze.
		
		However, when irradiated with a simulated Martian UV flux, 
		perchlorates become bacteriocidal. It ensures the low probability of 
		survival of biological contaminants released from robotic 
		and human exploration missions.
