<h2>Resource : "Polyester resin" (Liquid)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ul><li>
		Polyester resins are thermoplastic polymers. It's the most widely used resin systems in the marine industry. 
	 By far the majority of dinghies, yachts and workboats built in composites make use of this 
	 resin system. Polyesters are produced commercially both as saturated and unsaturated resins. 
	 The most common, highest volume produced polyester is Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a 
	 saturated polyester that finds utilization in such applications as fibers for clothing and 
	 carpet, food and liquid containers (such as a water/soda bottles), as well as films. 
	 PETâ€™s non-reactance with many foods makes it an ideal packaging material. Because 
	 of its easy application and durability, polyester resin is also applied to patch cracks 
	 and holes that need to remain watertight. See comparison between polyester resin and 
	 epoxy resin at https://www.pcepoxy.com/what-is-the-difference-between-epoxy-and-polyester-resin/
