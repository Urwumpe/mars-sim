<h2>Resource : "Thermoplastic Elastomer" (Solid)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ul><li>
		Thermoplastic elastomers (TPE), sometimes referred to as thermoplastic rubbers, are a 
		class of copolymers or a physical mix of polymers (usually a plastic and a rubber) 
		that consist of materials with both thermoplastic and elastomeric properties.
		
		The benefit of using thermoplastic elastomers is the ability to stretch to moderate 
		elongations and return to its near original shape creating a longer life and better 
		physical range than other materials.
		
		TPE film is added to the liquid cooling garment to allow for water vapor or 
		perspiration to travel out, away from the skin. The film is a monoflim membrance with 
		superior permeability, water-vapor transmittion, and tear strength properties. It would
		not allow water to penetrate in the opposite direction back to the skin. It is a one-way
		water-vapor transport wicking material that maintain a comfortable microclimate between 
		the fabric's surfaces closet to the skin.
