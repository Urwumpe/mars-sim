<h2>Resource : "Mudstone" (Solid)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ul><li>
  	 A rock succession on the lower slopes of Mount Sharp that comprises thinly laminated mudstones. 
  	 These rock outcrops are very fine-grained sedimentary rocks that we interpret as having formed 
  	 from particles suspended in water, which slowly settled.
