<H3>Step 6 : Time Tool</H3>
<hr>

<P>The <A HREF="timetool.html">Time Tool</A> keeps track of how date and time go by on Mars and Earth in mars-sim. </P>

<P>The Time Tool displays the current time in the simulation.</P>
<P>The Martian Time panel shows the current Martian time in the following format: 
Orbit-Month-Sol Millisol.</P>
<P>The second panel shows a calendar display of the month and the sol of the month.  
The one letter abbreviation for the weeksols are also given.</P>
<P>The Earth Time panel shows the current Earth time in GMT.</P>
<P>The Simulation Uptime panel shows the amount of time the simulation has been running in 
real world time.</P>
<P>The Ticks Per Second panel shows the average number of simulation clock ticks 
per real world second.  The larger the number, the faster the simulation is running.</P>
<P>The Pause button will pause the simulation.  Pressing the "Resume" button will resume 
the simulation.</P>
<P>The last panel shows the time compression for the simulation.  It displays the amount 
of simulation time per real world second.</P>
<P>The slider bar at the bottom of the panel allows the user to change the time compression 
ratio of the simulation.</P>
