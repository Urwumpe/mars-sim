    <h2> Resource - Acetylene</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Acetylene is a colorless gas that has a strong &#10;&#9; garlic-like odor. When combined with oxygen, it becomes very hot and is classified as the hottest fuel gas. &#10;&#9; It is also the only fuel gas that can weld and cut steel, making it the preferred choice for welders.&#10;&#9; The welding process that uses acetylene is known as oxy-fuel cutting or gas cutting. Acetylene is &#10;&#9; probably the hottest burning fuel gas available to us. Acetylene releases almost 40% of its heat in &#10;&#9; the inner flame cone. Acetylene is also commonly used for the production of other chemicals used &#10;&#9; in perfumes, vitamins, polymers, solvents and other materials due to its versatility and ease of&#10;&#9; reactive control in comparison to other gases. It combines nicely with a variety of elements and&#10;&#9; compounds, making it the most important of starting materials for organic synthesis.</p>
