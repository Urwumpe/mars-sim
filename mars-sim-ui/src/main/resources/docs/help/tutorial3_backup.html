<hr>

<P>At the top of the Main Simulation Window is the <A HREF="menubar.html">Menu Bar</A> with headings such as 
'<STRONG>File</STRONG>', '<STRONG>Tools</STRONG>', '<STRONG>Settings</STRONG>', and '<STRONG>Help</STRONG>'.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>File</STRONG> menu deals with the functions you are used to in most menu-driven programs: 
start a New simulation, Save (the default filename is 'default.sim') or Save As (the filename of your choice), and Exit the Simulation</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Tools</STRONG> menu shows a list of eight Tool Windows available for use in mars-sim.</P> 

<P>Each Tool Window let you observe and interact the settlement in a particular manner. </P>

<P>You can use an associated function key (F1 to F8) to activate each of them. See <A HREF="ui.html">User Interface</A> for more details.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Settings</STRONG> menu lets you choose between full-screen or window mode, skin theme and the volume of background music 
or sound effects.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Help</STRONG> menu contains the About, the Tutorial as well as the User Guide. 

<P>Directly below the Menu Bar is the Desktop area, where various Tool Windows reside</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Status Bar</STRONG> contains three items: a button for accessing the <A HREF="marsnet.html">MarsNet</A>, a text label showing 
mars-sim's memory usage on your computer, and a text label showing the current Earth date/time of the running simulation.</P>
