<H2>Backstory</H2>
<P>It is the year of 2028. Humanity has undertaken a massive international effort to explore and settle Mars. Sponsored and kick-started 
by numerous space agencies, new colonies are sprouting up, forming new human societies in this new world, on this new continent.</P>

<P>There are many types of settlements having unique objectives spreading out across the planet, ranging from a simple four-person initial landing habitats, 
to a mining town and more mature bases hosting dozens of people and advanced buildings. </P>

<P>Fortunately, settlers are skilled professionals. They are bringing their areas of expertise to the new colonies. For instance, 
they may tend greenhouses, produce food products, prospect minerals, maintain their vehicles and equipment, 
grow crops in their greenhouses, and manufacturing needed parts and equipment from collected local resources, 
engage in scientific inquiries about the origin of life, etc..</P>

<P>That said, some prefer to venture out on rover missions to study the surrounding area, explore uncharted territories, 
prospect and mine mineral concentrations, and trade with their neighboring settlements.</P>

<P>Mars's magnificent landscape is an untamed beauty but it can be hostile to the unsuspected. Has it always been a big, lifeless rock ? 
Its past ecosystem, if any, awaits humanity's investigation. </P>

<P>Settlers come face-to-face with meteorite impacts, radiation sickness, equipment malfunctions, accidents, illnesses, injuries, and even death. 
Survival depends on how well they work together in harmony, how they use their survival instincts and skills, and how they must balance their 
individual needs versus settlement goals.</P>

<P>As settlers survive hardship and build up their settlements, they are rewarded with the pure joy of participating in this 
grand social experiment of creating a new branch of human society on another planetary surface.</P>

<P>Living and thriving on Mars is full of challenges for sure. There are no success practices that one can follow. But at the end, 
it will worth the sum of all our efforts as we are becoming a multi-planetary species continuing our stories of someday living among the stars.</P>
