<H4>A. Steps</H4>
 
To put together a building, a construction site needs to go through the following 3 stages :
<OL>
	<LI>Laying the site foundation</LI>
	<LI>Framing</LI>
	<LI>Constructing the building</LI>
</OL>

In general, one must first build a foundation. Upon finishing the foundation, one may build a corresponding frame on top of it.
When the frame is done, one may construct a particular building over the frame.

There are a number of <a href="generated/construction/index.html">Construction Specifications</a> predefined.
